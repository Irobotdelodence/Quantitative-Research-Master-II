# Quantitative Research in Finance - M2 Master in Financial Markets and Sustainable Investments

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains the quantitative research I conducted during my second-year Master's program in **Financial Markets and Sustainable Investments** at Audencia. The projects cover a range of topics related to **Financial Modeling**, **Portfolio Management**, **Risk Management**, and **Quantitative Techniques**.

## Research Overview

1. **Financial Modeling**
    - Implementation of Hull-White and Libor Market Model (LMM) for pricing interest rate derivatives.
    - Model calibration to enhance derivative pricing accuracy and backtesting using Machine Learning techniques.

2. **Portfolio Management**
    - Application of Markowitz and Black-Litterman models for asset allocation using S&P 500 stocks.
    - Sensitivity analysis on portfolio optimization under various market assumptions.

3. **Risk Management**
    - Development and application of Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) models for forecasting future correlations of CAC 40 stocks.
    - Portfolio optimization based on correlation forecasts.

4. **Quantitative Techniques**
    - Use of the Random Tree method for pricing path-dependent options.
    - Creation of a MATLAB application to perform high-efficiency Monte Carlo simulations.
